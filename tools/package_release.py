README = """Melee Party {version}
========================

A native Windows build of Super Smash Bros. Melee NTSC 1.02 with Slippi: the game logic runs
exactly as on the GameCube at 60 Hz, the display renders at any rate (unlocked, monitor rate
or a fixed cap) with real in-between animation, DLSS/DLAA, a GameCube adapter and Slippi
online play.

You need your own Melee NTSC 1.02 ISO. Nothing from the game is included.

Not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the Slippi team, Nintendo or HAL Laboratory.
Bugs and questions about this build go to https://github.com/santiagopinto2/melee-party/issues,
not to the Slippi team.

Install: two ways, pick one
---------------------------
The launcher is OPTIONAL. Nothing in the game depends on it.

A. Manual (no launcher)
   1. Drag your Melee NTSC 1.02 ISO onto MeleeParty.bat, or put the ISO next to it named
      melee.iso and double-click MeleeParty.bat.
   2. That is it. The first launch precompiles the graphics pipelines (15 to 30 seconds,
      progress in the title bar). To update, extract a newer zip over this folder; your
      settings, saves and replays are kept.

B. Melee Party Launcher (optional convenience)
   1. Run MeleePartyLauncher.exe and drop the ISO onto its window (Build tab). It checks
      the disc, precompiles the graphics pipelines and remembers the path.
   2. Press PLAY. The launcher checks for new releases on every start and "Update and
      restart" installs one in place. It also shows which Slippi account will be used.
   3. Multiplayer Lobby: fill out your profile (name, location, three mains; your
      Slippi code comes from your linked Slippi account) and tick Go Online. Players
      exchange chat, friend requests, friend status and match requests directly; ping
      is measured once a match request is sent. Accepted games use Slippi Direct.
      Discovery can take time, and some networks cannot connect directly (no relay yet).

Either way, the PC settings panel opens on the first launch; later press F1 or click Settings:
fullscreen, frame rate cap, VSync, widescreen 16:9 (both Game Builds), internal resolution,
anti-aliasing (SSAA), anisotropic filtering, DLSS/DLAA, sharpening, sub-frame animation,
game and music volume. Settings persist in port-settings.ini.

Game Builds
-----------
The launcher's Build tab picks the Game Build: the Source Port (the game built from source) or the
Static Recomp (the original game code translated ahead of time; mod discs such as Akaneia run on
it). A compatibility build for older processors is included. Optional experimental DLSS 5 uses
NVIDIA's separate model, which is not included in this archive.

Controllers: a GameCube adapter (WUP-028, official or Mayflash in Wii U mode) is used
automatically if it has the WinUSB driver that Slippi installs. Close Slippi Dolphin first.
Native DualShock 4 support is experimental: connect by USB or Bluetooth, then select a DS4
tab in PC settings and assign it to a game port. The DS4 is read directly through Windows
Raw Input and does not require DS4Windows. USB and Bluetooth report layouts are supported.
Keyboard: arrows = stick, IJKL = C-stick, Z/X/C/V = A/B/X/Y, Enter = Start, Q/W = L/R, E = Z.

Slippi online: everything Slippi Dolphin does for netplay (matchmaking, rollback netcode, the
Slippi code set, replays, game reporting) is built into this program, so Slippi Dolphin is not
needed. Is the Slippi Launcher required? For online play, yes: a Slippi account is required and
accounts are created and logged in only through the Slippi Launcher (https://slippi.gg/downloads).
Install it, log in once, and the game picks up the login automatically (the Slippi Launcher also
installs the GameCube adapter driver). For offline play it is not required. Unranked, Direct codes
and Teams work against players on regular Slippi Dolphin.

Crashes: after a crash the launcher offers to send the report (crash text, minidump and logs) with
one click. Other bugs: https://github.com/santiagopinto2/melee-party/issues with melee_port.log,
port-settings.ini and the steps to reproduce.

Watching replays: drop a .slp file onto WatchReplay.bat. That runs melee_port_playback.exe, a
separate build of the game made for playback, so Slippi Dolphin is not needed to watch a replay
either. Your ISO has to be next to it named melee.iso. A replay recorded by a much newer or older
Slippi version may not line up with this build; when that happens the log says so rather than
playing something subtly wrong.

Saves: memory card slot A is the folder User\GC\CardA, one .gci per file (Dolphin's GCI folder
format). Copy your Slippi Dolphin save (GALE01-*.gci) there to keep your unlocks and settings.

Mods: put your own mod files in the Mods folder (or drop them on the launcher's Mods page). The
game recognizes known packs by their content. New supported and untested custom entries turn on;
unsupported versions stay off. Read each entry's compatibility warning. F1 > Mods (or
Start + Down + Z on a controller) has an On/Off switch for each. Training Mode CE and 20XX TE run on
the Source Port: 20XX TE's in-game menu is VS Mode > Tournament Melee, Training Mode CE's exercises
are under 1P Mode > Event Match. Akaneia runs on the Static Recomp (launcher > Mods > Play). The
20XX Training Hack Pack is not supported yet. See TrainingMods.md for compatibility and differences
from the original console mods.

Audio: F1 > Audio offers Auto (recommended: starts at the lowest buffer and backs off only after
real gaps), Low latency (a fixed buffer), Exclusive (takes over the output device), and ASIO(R)
for audio interfaces with a driver and buffer picker. Restart after changing the mode or driver.
ASIO and Exclusive can take the device; sharing depends on the interface driver.

Known gaps in this version: ranked play reports results but has not been tested in a live ranked set.
